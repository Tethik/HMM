Hidden Markov Models. Different algorithms used for hidden markov algorithms

Used for a university laboration, I just wanted to keep the code available for future projects.
Following algorithms within:
* Alpha/Beta Pass
* Viterbi algorithm
* Baum welch

Feel free to reuse, but dont expect anything to work as is. Like I wrote before, I'm only keeping this here for (personal) potential future reuse.
